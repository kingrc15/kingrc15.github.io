**Unlocking the Power of Multimodal Learning with Transformers**

As we continue to navigate the rapidly evolving world of artificial intelligence, one area that holds great promise for innovation and progress is multimodal learning. This research field combines multiple sources of data, such as text, images, and audio, to create a more comprehensive understanding of the world. In recent years, the transformer architecture has revolutionized the way we approach multimodal learning, and a new survey on this topic is sure to be of great interest to anyone working in the field.

**A Brief Introduction to the Challenge**

Multimodal learning, which involves learning from multiple sources of data, is a significant challenge in AI research. In the past, researchers had to rely on traditional approaches that were limited to a single modality, such as vision or language. However, as we increasingly interact with the world through multiple senses, the need for more comprehensive and integrated learning methods has grown.
