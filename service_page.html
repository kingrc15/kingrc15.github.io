							As a member of Tau Beta Pi we get to participate in various service projects in the College Station/Bryan area. We have been able to help at <a href="https://habitatbcs.org/restore/">Habitat for Humanity</a>, the <a href="https://habitatbcs.org/restore/">ReStore</a>, <a href="https://www.riseagainsthunger.org/">Rise Against Hunger </a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/tamuprojectdowntown/?tn-str=k*F">Project Downtown</a> and many more. I love being able to get out and help people in the surrounding community and Tau Beta Pi has given me some amazing opportunities to do that.

							In 2013, I received training from the Rockbridge Emergency Medical Response Team to become an EMT. Not only was this an amazing opportunity to help people in the area, it was also really fun to learn some lifesaving medical skills. After training, I served as an EMT for Rockbridge County, VA and for Virginia Military Institute. I was very privileged to be able to help cadets at my school as they pushed themselves to their physical limit in an effort to serve their country. Experiences gained while serving my school and the surrounding county showed me that hard work can have an enormous effect on the lives of others.

							I have been volunteering for Habitat for Humanity ever since 2010. I started in Roanoke, Virginia, where I was born and raised. I had an amazing supervisor while I was there who taught me everything he could about construction. I really enjoyed learning how to build homes but even more, I enjoyed the ceremonies we held for the recipients of the homes. It was amazing to see how both the workers and the recipients could benefit from the construction.
