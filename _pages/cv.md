## Professional Experience

### Graduate Research Assistant, Clinical AI Lab
**Texas A&M University** | Aug 2021 – Present

- **Led foundational research** in masked and contrastive pretraining for clinical data, designing novel architectures for uni-modal and bi-modal settings (EHR and clinical notes). Resulted in multiple first-author publications advancing zero-shot prediction and transfer learning in healthcare.
- **Directed a multidisciplinary team** of graduate and undergraduate researchers on projects involving generative modeling of EHRs, multimodal learning with imaging and waveform data, and incorporation of clinical interventions for causal inference in pretraining.
- **Designed lab onboarding infrastructure** and maintain two high-performance compute servers; created and published a [new student setup guide](https://kingrc15.github.io/setup/new-student-setup/) that improved onboarding efficiency and research productivity.
- **Co-authored two federal research proposals** (NSF Smart & Connected Health and NIH NLM R01), contributing sections on pretraining, data infrastructure, and evaluation methodology.

### Undergraduate Research Assistant, Bioinformatics Lab
**Texas A&M University** | Dec 2019 – May 2021

- **Selected for competitive research role** to develop methods for batch correction and fusion of scRNA-seq data using statistical and deep learning approaches.
- **Developed and evaluated a domain adaptation technique** that reduced batch effects via **Maximum Mean Discrepancy** minimization, improving model generalization across experiments.
- **Ported deep generative models** by translating a TensorFlow Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial Autoencoder (ZINB-AE) into PyTorch, enhancing usability and training stability.

### Infantry Officer, United States Army (Active Duty)
**1st Armored Division, Fort Bliss** | May 2015 – July 2019

- **Led operations and logistics** for a 120-soldier infantry company, deploying $80M in equipment across Syria, Iraq, and Kuwait under U.S. Central Command operations.
- **Served as executive officer and advisor** to the company commander; mentored and trained junior officers during high-intensity rotations in combat environments.
- **Engineered a custom logistics tracking system** integrated with the Army SAP platform, facilitating recovery of $300M in inventory through automated reconciliation processes.
- **Planned and executed adaptive supply chains** supporting 4 platoons under dynamic mission objectives, ensuring operational continuity across distributed regions.

## Teaching Experience

### Instructor of Record, CSCE 421: Machine Learning
**Texas A&M University**

- **Selected to teach** a class of 100 undergraduate students
- **Designed comprehensive curriculum** covering Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, and Auto-Encoders
- **Developed lectures, quizzes, homework assignments, projects, and exams** to facilitate student learning
