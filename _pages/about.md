## Professional Experience

### Graduate Research Assistant, Clinical AI Lab
**Texas A&M University** | Aug 2021 – Present

- **Pioneered multimodal medical LLM research** developing foundation models that unify clinical text, structured EHR data, and medical imaging. Designed novel architectures for bi-modal pretraining that enable zero-shot clinical reasoning and cross-modal knowledge transfer.
- **Led breakthrough work** in medical LLM pretraining, creating models that can simultaneously process clinical notes, lab values, vital signs, and imaging data. Resulted in multiple first-author publications demonstrating superior performance on downstream clinical tasks.
- **Directed a multidisciplinary team** of graduate and undergraduate researchers on cutting-edge projects involving medical LLM fine-tuning, multimodal clinical reasoning, and incorporation of clinical interventions for causal inference in pretraining.
- **Designed lab onboarding infrastructure** and maintain two high-performance compute servers; created and published a [new student setup guide](https://kingrc15.github.io/setup/new-student-setup/) that improved onboarding efficiency and research productivity.
- **Co-authored two federal research proposals** (NSF Smart & Connected Health and NIH NLM R01), contributing sections on multimodal medical LLM pretraining, clinical data infrastructure, and evaluation methodology for healthcare AI systems.

### Undergraduate Research Assistant, Bioinformatics Lab
**Texas A&M University** | Dec 2019 – May 2021

- **Developed and evaluated a domain adaptation technique** that reduced batch effects via Maximum Mean Discrepancy minimization
- **Ported deep generative models** by translating a TensorFlow Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial Autoencoder (ZINB-AE) into PyTorch

### Infantry Officer, United States Army (Active Duty)
**1st Armored Division, Fort Bliss** | May 2015 – July 2019

- **Led operations and logistics** for a 120-soldier infantry company, deploying $80M in equipment across Syria, Iraq, and Kuwait
- **Engineered a custom logistics tracking system** integrated with the Army SAP platform, facilitating recovery of $300M in inventory
- **Planned and executed adaptive supply chains** supporting 4 platoons under dynamic mission objectives

## Teaching Experience

**Instructor of Record, CSCE 421: Machine Learning** - Texas A&M University  
- Selected to teach a class of 100 undergraduate students
- Designed comprehensive curriculum covering Logistic Regression, SVMs, Decision Trees, CNNs, RNNs, and Auto-Encoders
- Developed lectures, quizzes, homework assignments, projects, and exams

## Service & Leadership

- **Young Professionals (YP) Chair** for IEEE-EMBS BHI 2025
- **Organized COVID-19 Data Competition** for four consecutive years
- **Mentored 25+ junior researchers**, including undergraduates and master's students
- **Reviewer** for NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, ML4H, BHI, JBHI, and Neurocomputing
