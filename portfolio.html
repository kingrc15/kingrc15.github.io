							<b>Progressive Neural Architecture Search</b> - Neural Architecture Search is a subfield of AutoML that attempts to find neural architecture that perform the best on a dataset. With <a href="https://stmi.engr.tamu.edu/">Dr Bobak Mortazavi</a> and <a href="http://www.atlaswang.com">Dr Zhangyang "Atlas" Wang</a>, we are developing a method of deriving neural architectures that progressively grow. We are using existing Neural Architecture Search methods to develop operations that are recycled into a search space for further growth. We are hopeful that this will eventually lead to even fewer hyperparameters when search for good architectures.

							<b>scRNA-seq GMVAE</b> - RNA sequence data has provided the biomedical community with amazing insight into the complex makeup of cells and their functionality. Single cell RNA sequencing examines the individual cells with more accuracy with the use of next-generation sequencing (NGS). Though sequencing techniques continue to improve, sequence data still suffers from various issues to include batch effect. With <a href="https://ibt.tamu.edu/faculty/k-zhang-bio.html">Dr Kurt Zhang </a> and his lab, we are developing a method of denoising batches of scRNA-seq data to remove batch effect. We use a Gaussian Mixture Variational Autoencoder to identify and denoise clusters in batches. We then use maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) in an attempt to remove batch effect between different batches of data.

							<b>BusIT</b> - In January 2020, I attend my first Hackathon. It was one of the most enjoyable experiences programming. My team and I worked on a lightweight bus route optimization alternative to the Texas A&M Bus app. To use the app, users simply needed to provide their location and their destination. The app would then provide the user with a route to the nearest bus stop that would get them as close as possible to their final destination. We ended up placing in the top 5! Check out our demo <a href='https://devpost.com/software/busit-i4370v#updates'>here</a> on DevPost.
