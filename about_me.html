							Howdy! Welcome to my page. I'm an undergraduate Computer Science major at Texas A&M University. I love machine learning and have been fortunate enough to get to work with multiple labs. Currently I do research with <a href="https://stmi.engr.tamu.edu/">Dr Bobak Mortazavi</a> and <a href="http://www.atlaswang.com">Dr Zhangyang "Atlas" Wang</a> on Progressive Neural Architecture Search and automated machine learning (AutoML) for medical information. Additionally I work as a research assistant for <a href="https://ibt.tamu.edu/faculty/k-zhang-bio.html">Dr Kurt Zhang </a> working on Gaussian Mixture VAEs for single cell RNA sequence (scRNA-seq) data. Though the majority of my work so far has been on the applications of machine learning in the medical field, I'm increasingly more interested in automating machine learning so that everyone can take advantage of it.

							In August of 2011, I matriculated into <a href="https://www.vmi.edu/">Virginia Military Institute</a>. During my time there, I served in various leadership positions within the Corps of Cadets while serving the Virginia National Guard. I also found time to become a EMT and ended up providing care to students and Virginia Military Institute and the Rockbridge area of Virginia. In May of 2015 I graduated with a Bachelor's Degreee in Civil Engineering and a Minor in Applied Mathematics.

							On May 15th, 2015, I accepted a commission as an active duty infantry officer in the United States Army. After a couple of months of training in Fort Benning, Georgia, I was stationed at Fort Bliss in El Paso, Texas. There I served as a Platoon Leader and Executive Officer through a deployment to Iraq and Syria in support of Operation Inherent Resolve and Operation Spartan Shield with <a href="https://www.facebook.com/1stArmoredDivision/?hc_ref=ARTvucIYVHYJth14958sHTojA0lgWL4Q_zmXLWTueRbaTPRVUUDmNJaempR2RYPRd2g&fref=nf&__tn__=kC-R"> B Co, 1-35 Armor Regiment, 2nd Brigade, 1st Armor Division</a>. In May of 2019, I left the Army to study Computer Science at Texas A&M University.

							Outside of school, I enjoy mountain biking and cooking. Most of my love of cooking comes from my love of eating though. I'm also a member of <a href="https://www.tbp.org/recruit/aboutRecruit.cfm">Tau Beta Pi</a>. We do a lot of volunteer work for the College Station/ Bryan Community.
