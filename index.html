# Welcome

I'm Ryan King, a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Texas A&M University, developing multimodal foundation models for healthcare applications. My research focuses on contrastive pretraining, transfer learning, and continual learning for Electronic Health Records (EHR) data.

## Research Interests

- **Multimodal Learning**: Developing methods to unify EHR time-series data and clinical notes
- **Contrastive Pretraining**: Creating foundation models for healthcare applications  
- **Transfer Learning**: Enabling model transferability across institutions and demographics
- **Continual Learning**: Lifelong learning approaches for evolving healthcare data

## Current Work

I'm currently working on:
- Bi-modal pretraining methods for EHR time-series data and clinical notes
- Zero-shot evaluation frameworks for healthcare models
- Transfer learning benchmarks for model transportability across institutions
- Multi-modal contrastive pretraining with unified training objectives

## Education

- **Ph.D. in Computer Science**, Texas A&M University (Expected 2026)
- **B.S. in Computer Science**, Texas A&M University (2019-2021), Summa Cum Laude
- **B.S. in Civil Engineering**, Virginia Military Institute (2011-2015)
